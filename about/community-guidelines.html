        >Hello. At EpicX, we want to create experiences that put smiles on
        faces, and we believe those smiles are for everyone. We also believe the
        best experiences happen when we all work together to keep our EpicX
        games, online services, and events safe, friendly, welcoming, and fun
        for all.</b

    <p class="cgparagpraph">
      Please take a few minutes to read our Community Guidelines, as they
      outline our expectations when engaging with our EpicX products, services
      or events.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="cgparagpraph">
      Be kind and respectful. Follow this timeless approach: treat others as you
      would like to be treated. Don’t be offensive, misrepresent, harass,
      threaten, discriminate against, or abuse anyone, and don’t act in any
      other manner that could disrupt the enjoyment of others or result in harm
      to anyone.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="cgparagpraph">
      Play by the rules. We ask that you use our software, services, and systems
      as they were intended to be used. Please don’t attempt to impair or get
      around measures in place to protect our software, services and content, or
      promote or engage in any other form of harmful, unauthorized, fraudulent
      or illegal behavior. Don’t create, share, or play unauthorized copies of
      our products or services, and don’t cheat.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="cgtitle"><b>Keep your account to yourself.</b></p>
    <br />
    <p class="cgparagpraph">
      Remember that your personal information and purchases are yours alone.
      Don’t sell, trade or otherwise transfer your purchases or user account to
      anyone.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="cgtitle"><b>Share thoughtfully.</b></p>
    <p class="cgparagpraph">
      Be mindful of what you share so others can enjoy your content, and please
      respect others’ contributions. Don't share personal information, content
      that is obscene, illegal or otherwise inappropriate, copies of products or
      services, copyrighted or trademarked works, commercial activity such as
      advertising or other promotional materials, or any other content that
      isn’t yours to share.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="cgtitle"><b>We’re building this community together.</b></p>
    <p class="cgparagpraph">
      Consider sharing these values when engaging with or guiding others to play
      our EpicX games, use our services, visit our events, or participate in our
      contests. By communicating these values to each other, we create a
      community that is both welcoming and enduring. Celebrate our shared
      passion for gaming. Please be mindful that not every topic that might be
      appropriate in other venues is appropriate on our products, platforms, and
      events, which are a celebration of our EpicX characters and worlds. We’re
      all here because we love games, and so we encourage everyone to share
      their passion for gaming at our events and on our platforms while keeping
      other topics to venues more appropriate for those conversations.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="cgtitle"><b>Speak up.</b></p>
    <p class="cgparagpraph">
      If you encounter any behavior or content that violates these guidelines,
      let us know. Many of our online services and games have built-in reporting
      features, or you can contact EpicX Customer Services if you see someone
      engaging in inappropriate behavior or sharing content that is obscene,
      illegal or otherwise inappropriate.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="cgparagpraph">
      Anyone who violates any of our user agreements or these community
      guidelines may be suspended or have access to games and/or services
      disabled, their user entries, content, or posts removed, and their entry
      to competitions, contests, locations, and events restricted. The easiest
      way to avoid this is for everyone to be respectful of others by following
      our community guidelines and any other additional expectations specific to
      EpicX products, services, events, competitions, or locations.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="cgparagpraph">
      Again, please have fun! We can all enjoy the world of EpicX and have the
      best time when we treat others with respect. Let’s work together to ensure
      our EpicX communities remain a fantastic place for all to feel welcome.
