        You can set gaming restrictions for the family right from your smart
        device with the free EpicX Parental Controls mobile app. While some
        parental controls are available on the system itself, this free app
        gives you even more options.
      </p>
      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        Simply follow the directions in the app to sync it with your system and
        your EpicX Account. Don’t have a EpicX Account?

      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        You can set limits on how long or how late the EpicX system can be used
        each day. When the time limit has been reached, an alarm notification
        will pop up on the EpicX screen.
      </p>
      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        The app will also tell you if the EpicX console stays on past this time
        limit. If needed, you can always set the system to automatically
        interrupt when the time’s up.
      </p>
      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        Parents can disable play time alarms and game suspension features
        temporarily or for a full day using their PIN. For more details about
        how to use EpicX Parental Controls, visit support.

      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        Since you won’t always be playing together with your kids, you can use
        the parental controls app to make sure you’re comfortable with how your
        EpicX system is being used. You can set restrictions on:
      </p>
      <i><p class="pcparagpraph">-Which games your family can play</p></i>
      <i><p class="pcparagpraph">-How long and how late they can play</p></i>
      <i><p class="pcparagpraph">-Sharing screenshots to social media</p></i>

      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        Different games have different social and online features that you may
        want to consider. With the parental controls mobile app, you can:
      </p>
      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        -Limit sharing of in-game text or images per game
      </p>
      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        -Restrict the ability to post screenshots to social media
      </p>
      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        You may also set restrictions on who can make EpicX eShop purchases via
        your EpicX Account* settings. To get started, visit

      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        To get started, open the System Settings icon on the HOME Menu, then
        select Parental Controls from the System Settings Menu. Create a

        It’s easy to change Parental Control settings based on the current
        player’s age. You can set appropriate boundaries for each child, even if
        your 8-year-old and 16-year-old are sharing the same system. You can
        learn how to change Parental Controls here.

      <p class="pcparagpraph">
        With Parental Controls and Content & Privacy Restrictions included on
        smart devices, you can block or limit specific apps and features on the
        device your child is using. The on-device Parental Controls and Content
        & Privacy Restrictions will not change the games you see in the app
        stores, including games you have purchased or recommended games. When a
        child tries to install a game, they will be taken to the app store where
        your parental controls settings may restrict access.
