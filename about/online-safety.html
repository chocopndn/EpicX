    <p class="osptitle"><b>Our Shared Commitment to Safer Gaming</b></p>
    <p class="ospparagraph">
      We play for many reasons: to indulge our imaginations, to socialize with
      friends or family, to test our skills against others, to learn through
      technology or just to relax and pass the time. Like other social
      activities, gaming creates meaningful connections with diverse players and
      reminds us that we have so much in common through the shared joy of play.
      <br />
      We believe gaming is for all people of all ages, including our youngest
      and most vulnerable players. Technology makes compelling entertainment
      experiences possible, and we want to ensure that those experiences –
      especially when they involve interaction with others – are positive and
      respectful. All players deserve to have fantastic social gaming
      experiences in settings where respect and safety are mutual.
      <br />
      At EpicX, we believe that protecting players online requires a
      multidisciplinary approach. We can accomplish more when we work toward the
      same goal, and so we will each continue investing in, evolving, and
      amplifying our approaches to user safety. As we continue this work, we
      will prioritize protecting the safety of our players, especially those
      most vulnerable.
      <br />
      The following principles guide our work.
    </p>

    <p class="osptitle">
      <b
        >Prevention: Empower players and parents to understand and control
        gaming experiences.</b
      >
    </p>
    <ul class="ospparagraph">
      <li>
        We provide controls that let players customize their gaming experience.
        We support parents with the tools and information necessary to create
        appropriate gaming experiences for their children.
      </li>
      <li>
        We recognize that for safety features to be useful, they must be easy to
        use. We will promote the availability of our safety tools through our
        platforms, support channels, services, on our websites and in retail
        stores to reach more players and parents.
      </li>
      <li>
        We continually inform our parents and players through our codes of
        conduct, terms of use, and our enforcement practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        We invest in technology to help thwart improper conduct and content
        before a player is subject to harm.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="osptitle">
      <b
        >Partnership: We commit to partnering with the industry, regulators, law
        enforcement, and our communities to advance user safety.</b
      >
    </p>
    <ul class="ospparagraph">
      <li>
        The industry’s commitment to safety is central. We believe that we have
        an opportunity to collaborate for the benefit of the video game industry
        and all players to offer a safer gaming experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        The work with industry trade organizations, industry members,
        regulators, law enforcement, and experts to develop and advance online
        safety initiatives.
      </li>
      <li>
        We commit to conducting shared research for the benefit of the industry.
      </li>
      <li>
        We believe that hate and harassment or exploitation of younger players
        in any way have no place in gaming. We partner with our community to
        promote safe gaming behavior and encourage the use of reporting tools to
        call out bad actors.
      </li>
      <li>
        We partner with ratings agencies such as the ESRB and PEGI to ensure
        that our games are rated for the appropriate audience.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="osptitle">
      <b
        >Responsibility: We hold ourselves accountable for making our platforms
        as safe as possible for all players.</b
      >
    </p>
    <ul class="ospparagraph">
      <li>
        We make it easy for players to report violations of our code of conduct
        and, in addition to removing content, we take appropriate enforcement
        actions for violations, including restricting players from using our
        services for misconduct.
      </li>
      <li>
        We comply with all local laws and will respond to all lawful requests
        from law enforcement. We promptly notify law enforcement if we observe
        unlawful conduct or where we believe a player is at risk of imminent
        harm.
      </li>
      <li>
        We publish our rules and requirements and we ensure that players who
        have been reported understand the requirements for continued engagement
        with our platforms.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="osptitle">
      <b
        >Protecting players can be challenging in a digitally and often
        instantaneously connected world. This partnership signifies our
        commitment to work together to improve player safety and ensure gaming
        remains truly for everyone. While the video game industry has a long
        history of taking steps to protect gamers, especially children, we
        recognize that no one company or industry will solve these challenges
        alone.</b
