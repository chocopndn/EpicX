      <ul class="srparagraph">
        <li>
          Set limits on gaming time to ensure a healthy balance between gaming
          and other activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be mindful of the content you consume and avoid games that promote
          violence, discrimination, or harmful behavior.
        </li>
        <li>Choose your games Strategically.</li>
        <li>
          Respect other players and avoid engaging in toxic or abusive behavior.
        </li>
        <li>Make a reward system.</li>
        <li>
          Take breaks during long gaming sessions to prevent physical and mental
          strain.
        </li>
        <li>Encourage inclusivity and diversity in gaming communities.</li>
        <li>Take responsibility and control.</li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to recommendations from people around, and do not
          neglect those of your family members, friends and colleagues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid using betting as the way to distract from life difficulties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not forget that betting is not a guaranteed source of income. It
          exists to entertain you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep up with the set money and time frames not only when losing, but
          also when winning. That is how you will always control yourself.
        </li>
        <li>Do not go in for betting when on alcohol or drugs.</li>
        <li>
          Don't take the games too seriously. Being more open and friendly to
          people you play with makes gaming more fun and exciting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refrain from wagering before you understand how a game is played and
          the odds of winning. Feel free to ask casino staff about game rules
          and chances.
        </li>
