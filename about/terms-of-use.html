      <b class="toutitle">7. Registration and Security.</b><br /><br />

      with a user ID and password. When registering for an account, you agree
      that you will (a) provide only accurate, complete, and up-to-date
      information, (b) maintain and promptly update your account information,

      EpicX has some of the most devoted, enthusiastic fans of any game
      developer. Each week, we receive hundreds of questions and suggestions
      about our games and systems. While we would love to use ideas from fans to
      develop actual products, due to the volume of requests we receive and the
      resources it would take to process them, we do not accept unsolicited game
      or product ideas. If you submit product suggestions, questions, creative
      materials, ideas or other information about our Services or Nintendo
      ("Submissions"), such Submissions, whether submitted via the Services or
      otherwise, will be non-confidential and shall automatically become the
      sole property of Nintendo. Nintendo shall own, and you hereby assign to
      Nintendo, all right, title and interest, including all intellectual
      property rights, in and to such Submissions and EpicX shall be entitled to
      the unrestricted use and dissemination of these materials for any purpose,
      commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.
      You agree to execute any documentation required by Nintendo (in our sole
      discretion) to confirm such assignment to, and unrestricted use and
      dissemination by, Nintendo of such Submissions.<br /><br />
      <b class="toutitle">9. Copyright Usage/Infringement Notices.</b
      ><br /><br />
      EpicX respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that
      your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright
      infringement, please follow our Intellectual Property Policy.<br /><br />
      <b class="toutitle">10. Modifying/Terminating Services.</b><br /><br />
      EpicX reserves the right to modify, update or discontinue our Services, or
      any features or portions thereof, without prior notice. You agree that we
      can suspend or terminate your right to access our Services at any time for
      any reason without notice, obligation or liability to you.<br /><br />
      <b class="toutitle"
        >11. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</b
      ><br /><br />
      USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION
      OR ADVICE GIVEN BY NINTENDO OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES CREATES A WARRANTY. THE
      SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. EPICX
      DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EPICX AND ITS AFFILIATED
      COMPANIES, LICENSEES, LICENSORS AND CONTRACTORS ("EPICX PARTIES") WILL NOT
      BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
      ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS, USE, MISUSE, OR INABILITY TO
      USE THE SERVICES, EVEN IF EPICX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
      SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, THE EPICX PARTIES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU
      IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICES
      IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT (IF ANY) YOU ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE SERVICES THAT
      ARE THE SUBJECT OF SUCH CLAIM. IF A LAW RESTRICTS OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT
      LIABILITY OR DISCLAIM WARRANTIES, THE LIMITATIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY NOT
      APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT CASE, WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY AND DISCLAIM WARRANTIES
      TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.<br /><br />
      <b class="toutitle">12. Indemnity.</b><br /><br />
      If the EpicX Parties are subject to any actual or threatened claims,
      costs, damages, losses, or other liabilities (collectively, "Covered
      Losses") as a result of your use of any of the Services, or any data,
      information, or other item you make available through the Services
      including User Content, then you agree to indemnify the EpicX Parties from
      all such Covered Losses and any related costs, such as reasonable
      attorney’s fees.<br /><br />
      You further agree to indemnify the EpicX Parties for any Covered Losses
      arising out of or related to: (a) any Submissions you provide; (b) your
      violation of these Terms; and (c) your violation of any rights of another.
      Some jurisdictions limit consumer indemnities, so some or all of the
      indemnity provisions above may not apply to you. If you are obligated to
      indemnify us, we will have the right, in our sole and unfettered
      discretion, to control any action or proceeding and determine whether we
      wish to settle it, and if so, on what terms.<br /><br />
      <b class="toutitle">13. Miscellaneous.</b><br /><br />
      If any part of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or for any
      reason unenforceable, then that part will be severed from these Terms, and
      the rest of the Terms will remain intact. If we do not enforce any
      provision of these Terms, that will not be considered a waiver of our
      rights. Any waiver of these Terms must be obtained in a written document
      signed by an authorized representative of EpicX.<br /><br />
      <b class="toutitle">14. Changes to these Terms</b><br /><br />
      We may change these Terms from time to time. If we do, we’ll provide
      notice of any changes, such as by posting the most recent version on our
      Services and updating the "Last Updated" date above. You can view the
      latest Terms any time by clicking the "Terms of Use" link at the bottom of
      the applicable webpage. We encourage you to check for updates regularly.
      Your continued use of the Services following any notice we provide will
      confirm that you have agreed to the amended Terms. If you do not agree to
      the amended Terms, you must stop using the Services.<br /><br />
