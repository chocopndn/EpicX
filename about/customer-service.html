    <p class="cstitle"><b>Our Priorities</b></p>
    <p class="csparagraph">
      Your customer service team communicates with customers on a daily basis,
      which means that they are directly responsible for representing your
      brand's mission and values. Great customer service can result in positive
      reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations for your business that can lead
      to new business. A positive public persona can strengthen the way people
      see your company, products or services.

    <p class="cstitle"><b>Consumers</b></p>
    <p class="csparagraph">
      Gaming stations are mobile entertainment units that mix a TV with a video
      game system for use in a hospital. They can also be positioned next to a
      bed, which helps kids feel less anxious when they play games with friends
      and relatives.
    </p>
    <p class="cstitle"><b>Supply Chain</b></p>
    <p class="csparagraph">
      We are certain that these initiatives will not only boost employee
      retention and productivity but also enable us to consistently manufacture
      attractive, high-quality products. This will allow us to bring smiles to
      everyone with whom Nintendo comes into contact, which naturally includes
      our customers. We will keep putting a strong emphasis on communication and
      understanding between parties, closely collaborating with our production
      partners to actively support CSR initiatives.
    </p>
    <p class="cstitle"><b>Employees</b></p>
    <p class="csparagraph">
      These groups promote employees coming together based on their shared
      backgrounds, experiences and interests, and support activities that
      promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
    </p>
    <p class="cstitle"><b>Environment</b></p>
    <p class="csparagraph">
      We will additionally supply the customer packaging that is entirely
      recyclable upon request. To guarantee that the materials are handled
      correctly and securely, all of our recycling partners are contractually
      obligated to hold R2 accreditation.
